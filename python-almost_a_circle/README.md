# Python - Almost a circle

- [0. All your files, classes and methods must be unit tested and be PEP 8 validated.](tests/)
- 1\. Write the first class Base: [models/base.py](models/base.py) [models/__init__.py](models/__init__.py)
- [2. Write the class Rectangle that inherits from Base:](models/rectangle.py)
- [3. Update the class Rectangle by adding validation of all setter methods and instantiation (id excluded):](models/rectangle.py)
- [4. Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def area(self): that returns the area value of the Rectangle instance.](models/rectangle.py)
- [5. Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def display(self): that prints in stdout the Rectangle instance with the character # - you donâ€™t need to handle x and y here.](models/rectangle.py)
- [6. Update the class Rectangle by overriding the __str__ method so that it returns [Rectangle] (<id>) <x>/<y> - <width>/<height>](models/rectangle.py)
- [7. Update the class Rectangle by improving the public method def display(self): to print in stdout the Rectangle instance with the character # by taking care of x and y](models/rectangle.py)
- [8. Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def update(self, *args): that assigns an argument to each attribute:](models/rectangle.py)
- [9. Update the class Rectangle by updating the public method def update(self, *args): by changing the prototype to update(self, *args, **kwargs) that assigns a key/value argument to attributes:](models/rectangle.py)
- [10. Write the class Square that inherits from Rectangle:](models/square.py)
- [11. Update the class Square by adding the public getter and setter size](models/square.py)
- [12. Update the class Square by adding the public method def update(self, *args, **kwargs) that assigns attributes:](models/square.py)
- [13. Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def to_dictionary(self): that returns the dictionary representation of a Rectangle:](models/rectangle.py)
- [14. Update the class Square by adding the public method def to_dictionary(self): that returns the dictionary representation of a Square:](models/square.py)
- [15. JSON is one of the standard formats for sharing data representation.](models/base.py)
- [16. Update the class Base by adding the class method def save_to_file(cls, list_objs): that writes the JSON string representation of list_objs to a file:](models/base.py)
- [17. Update the class Base by adding the static method def from_json_string(json_string): that returns the list of the JSON string representation json_string:](models/base.py)
- [18. Update the class Base by adding the class method def create(cls, **dictionary): that returns an instance with all attributes already set:](models/base.py)
- [19. Update the class Base by adding the class method def load_from_file(cls): that returns a list of instances:](models/base.py)
